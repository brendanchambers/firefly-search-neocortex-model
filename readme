# this experiment is to find a good way to measure asynchrony
        # the corrcoef distribution isn't working very well
           # going to try scaling of the corrcoef distribution with size of population subsample
network 1: lognorm_sigma = 0.5
network 2: lognorm_sigma = 2  TODO sweeep through a range once we get a feel for this

structuring the files this way to take care of multiple cpus in a simple way (todo should look into this in more detail)

p_ei and p_ie are left free for the fireflies - are we seeing different needs for coupling between E & I for narrow vs heavy tailed distributions?
p_ii and w_input are also subject to optimization




instructions:

1. configure_firefly
        set the config_prefix to save this setup so you can find it later
        keep a copy of the configuration file with the final results, for record keeping

2. run_firefly
        set the config_filestring to load the configuration you just made
        be sure to set the objective function in the section running the firefly algorithm

3. plot_firefly
        note: notice there are may be -Infinity entries in the JSON results. Currently these become nans when we read in
        set the results_filestring to load the results you just computed
        you will probably need to change the colormap lims
